  REBUILD EXE WITH FIXED IMAGE SUPPORT
========================================

The T-Rex image is now properly configured to be bundled with the .exe!

WHAT WAS FIXED:
✓ Updated build_exe.spec to include img folder correctly
✓ Fixed script to look for bundled images in PyInstaller's temp folder
✓ Image will now load properly when running as .exe

HOW TO REBUILD:

1. Double-click: build_exe.bat

   OR manually run:
   
   cd "C:\Scripts\YouTube Downloader"
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   pyinstaller build_exe.spec --clean --noconfirm

2. The new .exe will be in: dist\InGen-YouTube-Downloader.exe

3. Test it:
   - Run the .exe
   - You should see your T-Rex image (trex.png)
   - If not, you'll see the 🦖 emoji as fallback

TECHNICAL DETAILS:

When PyInstaller creates an .exe, it bundles all files and extracts them
to a temporary folder at runtime. This folder path is stored in sys._MEIPASS.

The code now:
- Checks if running as .exe (sys.frozen)
- If yes, looks for images in sys._MEIPASS/img/
- If no, looks in the normal script directory

Your trex.png (2.3MB) will be bundled inside the .exe and extracted when run!
