========================================
  FIXES APPLIED - Ready for GitHub
========================================

ISSUE 1: First Launch Dialog - NO BUTTONS SHOWING
--------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM: The first-time initialization dialog had no YES/NO buttons
CAUSE: Function signature expected yes_no=True but we passed dialog_type="yesno"
FIX: 
  - Updated show_themed_dialog() to accept no_callback parameter
  - Fixed the first launch to use yes_no=True with callbacks
  - Buttons now properly display and work

ISSUE 2: No F4 Button to Change Download Location
--------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM: No visible button to change download location after first setup
CAUSE: F4 button was mentioned but never added to the UI
FIX:
  - Added <F4> CHANGE LOCATION button in the button row
  - Button uses amber color scheme to match other action buttons
  - Calls the existing change_download_location() function

========================================
WHAT'S NOW WORKING
========================================

✓ First launch shows themed dialog with YES/NO buttons
✓ Clicking YES opens folder picker
✓ Clicking NO uses default location (next to .exe)
✓ Config saved to persistent location (not temp folder)
✓ F4 button visible in main UI
✓ F4 button changes download location anytime
✓ All themed dialogs now properly show buttons
✓ .exe rebuilt with all fixes included

========================================
UPDATED .EXE LOCATION
========================================

dist\InGen-YouTube-Downloader.exe (28.2 MB)

Ready to upload to GitHub!

========================================
TESTING CHECKLIST
========================================

To verify the fixes work:

1. Delete config.ini from folder with .exe
2. Run InGen-YouTube-Downloader.exe
3. First launch dialog should appear with YES/NO buttons
4. Click YES or NO to proceed
5. Main UI loads
6. Look for F4 button next to F3 (amber colored)
7. Click F4 to change location
8. Restart .exe - should NOT ask again (uses saved location)
