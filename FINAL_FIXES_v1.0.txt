========================================
  FINAL FIXES APPLIED - v1.0
========================================

ALL ISSUES RESOLVED
-------------------

ISSUE 1: First Launch Dialog - NO BUTTONS SHOWING
✓ FIXED: Added no_callback parameter to show_themed_dialog()
✓ FIXED: Changed dialog_type="yesno" to yes_no=True
✓ RESULT: YES and NO buttons now display properly

ISSUE 2: No F4 Button in Main UI
✓ FIXED: Added <F4> CHANGE LOCATION button
✓ RESULT: Button visible in main UI (amber colored)

ISSUE 3: Dialog Too Small (Had to Make it Larger)
✓ FIXED: Changed dialog size from 600x300 to 600x400
✓ RESULT: Buttons more visible, no need to resize

ISSUE 4: Clicking YES Did Nothing
✓ FIXED: Added wait=True parameter to show_themed_dialog()
✓ FIXED: Added self.root.wait_window(dialog) to block until user clicks
✓ RESULT: YES button now properly waits, opens folder picker, saves location

========================================
WHAT NOW WORKS PERFECTLY
========================================

First Launch:
✓ Dialog shows with visible YES/NO buttons
✓ Dialog is large enough (no resizing needed)
✓ YES: Opens folder picker, saves location to config
✓ NO: Uses default location (next to .exe), saves to config
✓ Config saved persistently (not in temp folder)
✓ Never asks again on future launches

Main UI:
✓ F1 - Initiate Download
✓ F2 - Choose Formats
✓ F3 - System Diagnostics (install dependencies)
✓ F4 - Change Location (NEW!)
